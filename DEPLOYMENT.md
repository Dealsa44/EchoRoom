# EchoRoom PWA Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution

The blank screen issue was caused by:
1. **Incorrect Vercel routing** - All requests were being redirected to index.html
2. **Service worker cache issues** - Trying to cache non-existent files
3. **Missing iOS PWA configurations**

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)
- Updated rewrite rules to exclude static assets
- Added proper cache headers for different file types
- Configured PWA-specific caching

### 2. Updated Service Worker (`public/sw.js`)
- Removed references to non-existent build files
- Added better error handling
- Updated cache version

### 3. Enhanced App Initialization
- Added loading state to prevent blank screens
- Improved error handling in main.tsx
- Added React import for hooks

### 4. iOS PWA Support
- Added proper iOS meta tags
- Configured status bar styling
- Added touch icons

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Clear PWA cache on device:**
   - Remove PWA from home screen
   - Clear Safari cache: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data
   - Re-add PWA from website

## Testing

1. **Test in browser first** - Ensure the app loads in Safari
2. **Check console for errors** - Look for any remaining JavaScript errors
3. **Test PWA functionality** - Add to home screen and test offline functionality

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all static assets are being served correctly
3. Test with different browsers/devices
4. Check service worker registration in browser dev tools

## PWA Features

- Offline support via service worker
- Add to home screen functionality
