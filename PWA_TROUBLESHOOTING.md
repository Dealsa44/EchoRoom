# PWA Troubleshooting Guide for EchoRoom

## Common Issues and Solutions

### iOS PWA Profile Access Issues

If you're experiencing problems accessing your profile on iPhone/iPad when using the app from the home screen:

#### **Quick Fixes:**

1. **Open in Safari Browser Instead**
   - Remove the app from your home screen
   - Open Safari and go to the EchoRoom website
   - Log in normally through the browser

2. **Clear App Data**
   - Go to Settings > Safari > Advanced > Website Data
   - Find EchoRoom and tap "Remove All Data"
   - Re-add the app to your home screen

3. **Check Privacy Settings**
   - Go to Settings > Safari > Privacy & Security
   - Ensure "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" is OFF
   - Turn OFF "Block All Cookies" temporarily

#### **Advanced Solutions:**

4. **Reinstall PWA**
   - Remove the app from home screen
   - Clear Safari website data
   - Visit the website again in Safari
   - Add to home screen again

5. **Use Private Browsing**
   - Open Safari in private mode
   - Navigate to EchoRoom
   - Add to home screen from private mode

### **Why This Happens:**

- **iOS Safari Restrictions**: iOS has stricter privacy policies for PWAs
- **localStorage Limitations**: Some iOS versions block localStorage in PWA mode
- **Service Worker Conflicts**: iOS Safari handles service workers differently
- **Privacy Settings**: iOS privacy features can interfere with PWA functionality

### **Prevention:**

- Keep iOS updated to the latest version
- Use Safari browser for initial setup
- Avoid clearing all website data frequently
- Check privacy settings before adding PWAs

### **Alternative Solutions:**

If PWA continues to have issues:

1. **Bookmark Instead**: Add the website as a Safari bookmark
2. **Use Browser**: Access EchoRoom directly through Safari
3. **Desktop Mode**: Use the desktop version on mobile Safari

### **Technical Details:**

The app now includes:
- Enhanced error detection for PWA environments
- Fallback storage methods for iOS devices
- Automatic recovery mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages with solutions

### **Support:**
